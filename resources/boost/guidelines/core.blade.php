## Vendra Transaction

The `misaf/vendra-transaction` package owns financial transaction management with multi-gateway support, status tracking, and metadata and the Filament admin UI for transactions, gateways, fees, and limits.

### Standards

### Translatable Persistence

- Making a persisted model field translatable is an explicit domain choice unless this package already requires it.
- Every field listed in a model's `$translatable` array must definitely use a JSON database column. Keep its model traits/casts, factories, validation, Filament locale UI, API serialization, and tests translation-aware.
- A field not listed in `$translatable` must use the appropriate scalar database type and must not use Spatie Translatable, translatable slug traits, locale switchers, translated callbacks, or translation-shaped array data.

- Keep transaction domain code inside `packages/vendra-transaction` using the `Misaf\VendraTransaction` namespace.
- Use this package for models, migrations, factories, seeders, policies, permission enums, observers, Filament resources, translations, config, and package bootstrapping.
- Follow the concrete models and neighboring files in this package; do not apply translation, media, slug, sorting, or soft-delete patterns unless the affected model already uses them.
- Tenant awareness is owned by `misaf/vendra-support` via `Misaf\VendraSupport\Support\TenantAwareness`, which derives purely from the bound `TenantResolver`. Installing a tenant provider (e.g. `misaf/vendra-tenant`) makes the app tenant-aware; without one the default null resolver keeps it disabled. The module defines no `tenant_aware` config.
- Keep the module tenant-agnostic: it must build and run with or without a tenant provider. Never reference a concrete provider such as `Misaf\VendraTenant` anywhere — models, migrations, factories, seeders, or fixtures. Let `BelongsToTenant` assign `tenant_id`; do not set it manually.
- Tag-consuming models must use `Misaf\VendraSupport\Traits\HasOptionalTags` as the single source of their `tags()` relationship and pivot metadata. Keep the package tag-agnostic: define a stable package-owned tag type, use `TagIntegration` for availability and UI integration, never import the concrete Vendra Tagger model/provider or define the relationship through Spatie `HasTags`, and keep Tagger in Composer `suggest` rather than `require`.
- Preserve the current Filament structure: transaction and gateway resources define their forms and tables inline, while relation managers own their own schemas. Do not require `Schemas/*Form.php` or `Tables/*Table.php` classes unless the resources are deliberately refactored together.
- Because the package resources declare a `$cluster`, keep their complete resource trees under `src/Filament/Clusters/Resources/`, use the matching `Misaf\VendraTransaction\Filament\Clusters\Resources` namespace, and keep plugin discovery aligned. Any future resource without a cluster must instead live under `src/Filament/Resources/`.
- Keep cluster resources ungrouped and assign `$navigationSort` from their package-specific `NavigationPriority` cases; never hardcode numeric resource sort values.
- Provide separate singular and plural resource labels in `en`, `de`, and `fa`: model labels use the singular key, while navigation and plural model labels use the plural key. Keep navigation labels at 24 characters or fewer.
- Follow Laravel comment style: document with PHPDoc (array shapes, generics, `@see`) and reserve inline comments for genuinely complex logic. Match the surrounding file and do not add comments that restate the code.
- Add or update Pest tests for policy coverage, config/navigation behavior, translation parity, model contracts, and user-visible Filament behavior.
- Keep tests purposeful and prevent unnecessary ones: cover behavior, contracts, and edge cases — not framework internals or trivially typed code. Do not duplicate coverage a focused test already proves, and do not add throwaway verification scripts when a test fits.
- Keep Pest architecture tests in `tests/ArchTest.php`: the `php`, `security`, and `laravel` presets plus a tenant-agnostic expectation, e.g. `arch()->expect('Misaf\VendraTransaction')->not->toUse('Misaf\VendraTenant')`.
