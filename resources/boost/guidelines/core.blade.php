## Vendra Transaction

The `misaf/vendra-transaction` package owns the wallet/ledger financial domain: per-user, per-currency `Wallet` balances, immutable `LedgerEntry` records, gateway-labelled `Transaction` lifecycles driven by a Spatie model-states machine, plus fees, metadata, limits, and the Filament admin UI for transactions, gateways, and wallets.

### Translatable Persistence

- Making a persisted model field translatable is an explicit domain choice unless this package already requires it.
- Every field listed in a model's `$translatable` array must definitely use a JSON database column. Keep its model traits/casts, factories, validation, Filament locale UI, API serialization, and tests translation-aware.
- A field not listed in `$translatable` must use the appropriate scalar database type and must not use Spatie Translatable, translatable slug traits, locale switchers, translated callbacks, or translation-shaped array data.

### Vendra Transitive API Policy

- Treat a Vendra dependency intentionally exposed through the public API of a directly required Vendra platform package as part of the supported public contract of that package.
- Do not add a redundant direct Composer requirement solely because source code imports a type from that exposed dependency.
- Apply this only to Vendra platform packages listed under `require`; never extend it to `require-dev`, `suggest`, incidental implementation dependencies, or third-party packages. Removing or replacing an exposed dependency is a breaking change; keep `self.version` alignment across the Vendra package graph.

- Register every table whose migration calls `TenantSchema::addTenantColumn()` with `TenantTableRegistry` in this package's service provider, preserving configured table names and connections, so `vendra-tenant:enable {tenant}` can retrofit schemas migrated before tenancy was enabled.

- Keep transaction domain code inside `packages/vendra-transaction` using the `Misaf\VendraTransaction` namespace.
- The ledger is the single source of balance truth: wallet `balance` is a cache written only by `Services\LedgerService` under a row lock, every movement is an immutable `LedgerEntry` with a `balance_after` snapshot, and `vendra-transaction:verify-balances` recomputes and optionally repairs drift. Never update `wallets.balance` or ledger rows directly.
- Transaction lifecycle is a Spatie model-states machine under `States\` (`Pending → Processing → Review → Approved/Declined/Failed`). Settlement into the ledger happens exactly once, inside `ApproveTransactionTransition`, atomically with the status write. Change status only through `approve()`, `decline()`, `fail()`, `markProcessing()`, `markReview()` — never by writing the column.
- `transactions.amount` is always the absolute value in the wallet currency's minor units; the ledger sign derives from `TransactionTypeEnum::ledgerSign()`. Transfers store a `counterparty_wallet_id` and settle as two entries; fees settle as their own negative entry.
- Stay decoupled from any concrete user module: resolve the user model through `Support\TransactionUsers::model()` (`auth.providers.users.model`) and never import `Misaf\VendraUser`. Currency coupling goes through `misaf/vendra-currency` (`Wallet` belongs to `Currency`).
- Gateways are admin-managed labels only (translatable `name`/`description`, scalar `slug`, media logo, sortable). Payment processing logic does not belong in this module. Resolve gateways by scalar slug via `TransactionService`; the internal gateway slug is `TransactionService::INTERNAL_GATEWAY_SLUG`.
- Keep the Filament structure: because the package resources declare a `$cluster`, keep their complete resource trees under `src/Filament/Clusters/Resources/` with dedicated `Schemas/*Form.php` and `Tables/*Table.php` classes, state-transition actions under the resource `Actions/`, and dashboard widgets in `src/Filament/Widgets/`. Any future resource without a cluster must instead live under `src/Filament/Resources/`. Wallets are read-only resources (no create/edit); ledger relation managers stay read-only.
- Keep cluster resources ungrouped and assign `$navigationSort` from the shared `NavigationPriority` cases; never hardcode numeric resource sort values.
- Tenant awareness derives purely from the bound `TenantResolver` in `misaf/vendra-support`; never reference `Misaf\VendraTenant`. Let `BelongsToTenant` assign `tenant_id`.
- Tag-consuming models must use `Misaf\VendraSupport\Capabilities\HasOptionalTags` as the single source of their `tags()` relationship and pivot metadata. Keep the package tag-agnostic: define a stable package-owned tag type, use `TagIntegration` for availability and UI integration, never import the concrete Vendra Tagger model/provider or define the relationship through Spatie `HasTags`, and keep Tagger in Composer `suggest` rather than `require`.
- Provide separate singular and plural resource labels in `en`, `de`, and `fa`; keep translation keys sorted and in parity across locales, and navigation labels at 24 characters or fewer.
- Follow Laravel comment style: document with PHPDoc (array shapes, generics, `@see`) and reserve inline comments for genuinely complex logic.
- Use nullable `transactions.idempotency_key` for retry-safe creation. `TransactionService::createTransaction()` must return the original transaction for an identical key and financial payload, and reject reuse for different details. Keep it in the consolidated create migration and its package stub; do not add a follow-up alteration migration.
- Keep tests purposeful: ledger integrity, state transitions, limits, service contracts, policy coverage, translation parity, and user-visible Filament behavior.
- Keep Pest architecture tests in `tests/ArchTest.php`: the `php`, `security`, and `laravel` presets plus `arch()->expect('Misaf\VendraTransaction')->not->toUse('Misaf\VendraTenant')` and `->not->toUse('Misaf\VendraUser')`.
